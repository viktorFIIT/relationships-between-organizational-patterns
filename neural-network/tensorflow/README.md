# How to use

This folder contains 4 trained implementations of the neural networks coded in Python v. 3.8.0. First of these files is better suitable for research, because it is coded solely in Python.

File ```analysis-of-optimalization-algorithms``` is a Jupyter notebook with 3 multi-layer perceptrons. These can be used to predict probability of the patterns in a dataset.
File ```softmax-classification-in-tensorflow-keras``` is implementation of the Softmax classification in TensorFlow framework (and its Keras facade) which can be used to classify patterns based on the maximum likelihood.
