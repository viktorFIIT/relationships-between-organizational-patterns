# How to use

Install Python and Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab. Then run from this folder as ```jupyter notebook```. You app is accessible at ```http://localhost:8889/?token=<your-token>```.

ANN is implemented in Python 3.8.0, TensorFlow: https://www.tensorflow.org/ and Keras: https://keras.io/

# Why we should use Artificial Neural Networks to search for hidden relationships between patterns?

Simply because they are one of the most effective techniques how to encode information about the real world
in artificial representation (hidden layers of neural networks.) They are the technique which allows us to
learn these representations. Learned representations are considered much more efficient than hand-crafted
representations (e.g. with Prolog or other languages for building knowledge base.)

# Why we should use Deep Learning techniques for this instead of the machine learning techniques?

Deep learning techniques solve tasks which cannot be solved with simple machine learning techniques. They
allow us to represent information about the processes described in organizational patterns and learn these
representations automatically. This means to automatically enhance them to be better representations.

# Why do we need to use multi-layer neural networks to search for hidden relationships between patterns?

Each of the layers represent information about the pattern in some level. Combination of the layers together
solve our problem. Thus we try to decompose our bigger problem to the smaller parts - layers of the ANN.
Almost all ML techniques can be transformed to their neural network representation (ANN with 3 layers max.)

# What is the biggest advantage of ANN and deep learning? Why we should use these techniques here?

Artificial neural networks allow us to generalize and abstract information we find in the study of org.
patterns. Deep learning techniques allow us to learn these representations and enhance them.
